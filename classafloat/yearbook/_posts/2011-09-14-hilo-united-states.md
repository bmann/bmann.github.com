Our arrival in Hawaii had been long awaited after experiencing 12 days of the roughest weather we had seen so far.

The big island of Hawaii was a surprise to most of us as we expected beaches, hotels, and surfers, but instead saw rain forests, volcanoes, and immense cliffs forming the sea shore.

Time in Hilo was spent discovering volcanoes, swimming at the black sand beach, and buying junk food for the next sail. Calling home was definitely a priority, as we informed our families of homesickness, seasickness, and the real experience of sailing a tall ship.

The rough weather meant that we were traveling in the wake of some tropical storms, which meant high winds and huge ocean rollers: giant, broad waves that meant the ship was constantly moving up and down. It was on this 12 day stretch (one of the longest of the entire 11 month voyage) that you either got over being seasick, or figured out you were one of those people that were always seasick.

The group photo with people holding up their arms spell 'Paul' - the first person to leave the ship. Paul fell into the latter category of always-seasick people. He was sick almost the entire time, and lost a ton of weight, so he made the decision to fly home.

I remember being down and out for 3 days straight, and then I was 'cured' of seasickness, and have never been sick since.

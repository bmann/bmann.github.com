First stop. An American logging town. We walked on her hilled downtown streets, browsed the thrift shops, touched the spiny sea thingers in the marine museum, and started our world-wide patronage of the golden arches. Yet, if we were blessed with the skills of the prophets, the foresight of Nostradamus, we would have flooded the market and bought the whole darn town out of Gravol.

The golden arches is a reference to McDonald's. McDonald's, like Coke, is (unfortunately) available almost anywhere in the world. I don't recall if I had McDonald's or not (as some may know, I've been McDonald's-free since late August 1998).

Why stop in Port Angeles, maybe barely a days travel from Vancouver? Simple. Gas was much, much cheaper in the US than filling up in Canada â€“ something to consider when you're filling a 570 hp engine.

At the time, I also had a very romantic view of what it meant to be going to sea. So of course I bought a corncob pipe. Yes, you read that correctly. Luckily, I'm pretty sure there is no photograph evidence of.

Poor gone little Wotje, raped by the juggernaut of an industrial complex gone mad.

Happy Wotje, singing kids and basketball and fruit. Gorgeous Wotje of pink sand beaches, warm lagoons, jungle.

Ugly Wotje of bunkers, concrete, and infected sores.

A gift of a shell from a little girl in tattered cast-off clothes.

What to make of you? Happy island paradise, still quaffing the bitter draughts of history. Good luck to yours the children of Wotje.

My memories are sweetly sad.

I don't remember much at the moment. Was this island where we were given money to try and forage for a picnic or whatever we could buy at local supply huts? There is a memory of giant tins of corned beef being opened with a Swiss army knife can opener, and of jumping from a bridge into the water. Later, finding that the warm lagoon was still used to dump sewage into.

Or is does this memory fragment belong to [Tarawa](tarawa-kiribati/)?

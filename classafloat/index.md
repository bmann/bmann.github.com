title: Class Afloat 1993 - 1994
---

In 1993, I graduated from Sentinel Secondary School in West Vancouver. In late August of that same year, I boarded the 188ft tall ship, the _S/V Concordia_, and spent 11 months traveling around the North and South Pacific as a student of the [Class Afloat](http://www.classafloat.com) program.

## Pages

* [S/V Concordia](sv-concordia) - the ship that was our home for nearly a year, now sunk off the coast of Brazil in February of 2010
* [About Class Afloat](about-class-afloat) - some thoughts I have about my experience, and what I tell people if they ask if they should go / should send their kids

## Sections

* [Class Afloat Yearbook](/classafloat/yearbook/)

## TO DO

A possible list of to-dos.

* upload all scanned images to Flickr and then embed here - benefit would be overlay notes, incl. identifying people, setting location in a map, and then being able to embed the entire map somewhere
* authors of pages use initials - need to track down actual author full names, write blurb for each one
* fill out about Class Afloat page
* fill out S/V Concordia page

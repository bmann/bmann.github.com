title: Class Afloat 1993 - 1994
---

In 1993, I graduated from Sentinel Secondary School in West Vancouver. In late August of that same year, I boarded the 188ft tall ship, the _S/V Concordia_, and spent 11 months traveling around the North and South Pacific as a student of the [Class Afloat](http://www.classafloat.com) program.

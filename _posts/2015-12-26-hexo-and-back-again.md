I spent a chunk of time taking what was a very bare bones Jekyll site and mucked about with [Hexo](http://hexo.io). Which of course means that you need to run a generate step.

I very briefly fiddled with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) today, before realizing that a "plain" Jekyll site made the most for something that I'm going to update very infrequently, and ideally should be able to edit directly through GitHub.
